## How It's Made

**Tech used:** NextJS, MondDB, Redux Toolkit, Cookie, Paypal

This site was fun to make. I first started with dummy data to get the pages to look nice. I really liked implementing the addition of toppings and the pizza sizes. Doing the admin panel was interesting. It's a single user sign in currently, with that user being the admin. The admin is able to progess orders and handle all actions having to do with their products.

## Future Plans/Optimizations

Allowing users to make accounts would be a good feature. This could also lead to the company giving discounts to customers that order a certain amount. Implementing things like ratings could be interesting as well.

## Lessons Learned

I learned a different, more interesting way to do admin panels.
